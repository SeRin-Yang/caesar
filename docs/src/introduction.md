# Introduction

Hello and welcome!
This is the user documentation for [_Caesar_](https://github.com/Philipp15b/caesar), a deductive verification framework for quantitative programs.

---

**This is research software** and we're still working on a nice user interface, documentation, and fixing bugs.
Do not hesitate to open an issue or send an email to [phisch@cs.rwth-aachen.de](mailto:phisch@cs.rwth-aachen.de) with questions or ideas.
I am also happy to discuss anything via Zoom as well!

Start with the  [quick start guide](./quickstart.md)!

General things about the tool is documented in the [Caesar](caesar.md) chapter.
We have a section on the [pGCL frontend](frontends/pgcl.md).
There is also a chapter on the [HeyVL language](heyvl/) and the [standard library](stdlib/).

This work is based on [Philipp Schroer's 2022 master's thesis](schroer_msc_thesis.pdf).
You are encouraged to look there for in-depth information about the theory with proofs related to the constructions and more.
Some details about the syntax and current feature set of the tools might not be up to date, but the thesis gives an overview of most of the important (and new!) ideas and why they work.
