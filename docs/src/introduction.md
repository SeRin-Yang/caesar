# Introduction

Hello and welcome!
This is the user documentation for [_Caesar_](https://github.com/Philipp15b/caesar), a deductive verification framework for quantitative programs.

---

**This is research software** and we're still working on a nice user interface, documentation, and fixing bugs.
Do not hesitate to open an issue or send an email to [phisch@cs.rwth-aachen.de](mailto:phisch@cs.rwth-aachen.de) with questions or ideas.
I am also happy to discuss anything via Zoom as well!

Start with the  [quick start guide](./quickstart.md)!

General things about the tool is documented in the [Caesar](caesar.md) chapter.
We have a section on the [pGCL frontend](frontends/pgcl.md).
There is also a chapter on the [HeyVL language](heyvl/) and the [standard library](stdlib/).
