# Installing Caesar

You can download a pre-built Caesar binary or Docker image, or manually build Caesar locally.

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

```mdx-code-block
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc} />
```

## Option A: Download Pre-Built Releases (Recommended)

### a) Pre-Built Binary

1. Go to the [latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/releases/latest) and download the release for your operating system.

2. Extract the `caesar` binary from the downloaded archive.

  You may have to [release the binary from quarantine](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) to allow execution:
  ```bash
  # Execute in the extracted folder
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./caesar
  ```

### b) Docker Image

We also provide a Docker image.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/moves-rwth/caesar:latest
```

You can use this Docker image just like the `caesar` binary.
To access files from your system you need to mount them as volumes.
For example, if you want to verify a program in `./programs/example.heyvl`, the following command mounts the `./programs/` directory as `/root/caesar/programs/` inside the container and uses `caesar` to verify `example.heyvl`.

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD/programs:/root/caesar/programs/ ghcr.io/moves-rwth/caesar:latest /root/caesar/programs/example.heyvl
```

## Option B: Compiling Locally

### a) Build Binary

#### Installing Dependencies

You will need to install some dependencies manually:

**Rust:** To install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), we recommend [installation via rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
You might need to restart your terminal after installing Rust.

**Build Tools:** Caesar builds [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) itself, so we need [Python](https://www.python.org) and [cmake](https://cmake.org/).

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

  ```bash
  # Install Rust via rustup
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  # Install Python and CMake
  brew install python cmake
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian/Linux">

  ```bash
  # Install Rust via rustup
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  # Install Python, CMake, LLVM and clang
  apt-get install python3 cmake llvm-dev libclang-dev clang
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

  1. [Follow the instructions](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust via rustup.
  2. Install Python, CMake and LLVM
  ```bash
  choco install python cmake llvm
  ```

</TabItem>

#### Compiling Caesar

Simply run the following, and `caesar` will be available on the command-line.
Because this will compile a large number of dependencies, this might take a couple of minutes (especially Z3 takes some time).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar.git
cd caesar
cargo install --path . caesar
```

Then, you can run an example:
```bash
caesar tests/zeroconf.heyvl 
```
And this will print:
```
tests/zeroconf.heyvl::arp: Verified.
tests/zeroconf.heyvl::zeroconf: Verified.
```

### b) Docker Image

We also support building a Docker image.
This does not require installing dependencies and will package everything in a Docker image named `caesar`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:moves-rwth/caesar.git
cd caesar
docker build -t caesar -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

With the Docker image `caesar` built, you can use it just like the `caesar` binary.
To access files from your system you need to mount them as volumes.
For example, if you want to verify a program in `./programs/example.heyvl`, the following command mounts the `./programs/` directory as `/root/caesar/programs/` inside the container and uses `caesar` to verify `example.heyvl`.

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD/programs:/root/caesar/programs/ caesar /root/caesar/programs/example.heyvl
```
