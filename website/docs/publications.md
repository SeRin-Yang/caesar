Caesar is a project from a collaboration of the [Chair for Software Modeling and Verification (MOVES)](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/) at RWTH Aachen University, the [QUAVE group](https://quave.cs.uni-saarland.de/) at Saarland University and the [SSE section](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/software-systems-engineering) at Denmark Technical University.
If you are interested in collaborations or simply have some questions, please reach out to [Philipp Schroer](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/people/philipp-schroer/) ([phisch@cs.rwth-aachen.de](mailto:phisch@cs.rwth-aachen.de)).

## OOPSLA '23: A Deductive Verification Infrastructure for Probabilistic Programs {#oopsla-23}

HeyVL and Caesar were first published at [OOPSLA '23](https://2023.splashcon.org/track/splash-2023-oopsla): [A Deductive Verification Infrastructure for Probabilistic Programs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3622870) by Schröer et al.
